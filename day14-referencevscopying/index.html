        let age2 = age;

        age = 200; //changing the original variable doesn't update age2

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log(players, team);
        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        //team[3] = 'Lux';
        console.log(players, team);//if you update an array it will always reference back and change original too

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice();//slice with nothing passed will take a COPY of the array
        team2[3] = 'Lux';
        console.log(players, team2);
        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
        console.log(team3)

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        const team4 = [...players];
        team4[3] = "John";
        console.log(team4);
        console.log(players);//untouched

        //this works too
        const team5 = Array.from(players);
        team5[3] = 'Jane';
        console.log(team5);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        //const captain = person;
        //captain.number = 99;
        //console.log(person);//original updated too
        //console.log(captain);

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
        console.log(person);
        console.log(cap2);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = { ...person };
        console.log(cap3);

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        const wes = {
            name: 'Wes',
            age: 100,
            social: {

                facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
            }
        }
        console.log(wes);
        const dev = Object.assign({},wes);
        dev.social.twitter = 'coolman';// will also update original object as it's a second level part of the array
