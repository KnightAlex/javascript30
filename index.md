During October 2022 I decided to do the [Wes Bos Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge.

## Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit
This lesson taught me how to listen for key press events, and trigger audio to play as well as adding and removing a class to the corresponding element.
[Demo here](day1-drumkit)
