During October 2022 I decided to do the [Wes Bos Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge.

## Day 1: Drum Kit
This lesson taught me how to listen for key press events, and trigger audio to play as well as adding and removing a class to the corresponding element.
[Demo here](day1-drumkit)

Today I learned to get the current time and use maths and Javascript to set and rotate the clock hands in real time
[Demo here](day2-clock)

## Day 3: CSS variables and JS
This lesson showed how to use and update CSS variables with Javascript

## Day 4: Array cardio day 1
Did lots of cool things with arrays like `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()` and `reduce()`

## Day 5: Flex gallery
Today's exercise was all about using Flexbox and some event listeners to make a cool expanding gallery.

## Day 12: Key sequence detection
Splicing presses into an array, converting to a string and comparing to a secret code to make unicorns appear.

## Day 14: Object and Arrays - reference vs copy
Some handy stuff here with learning to copy an object or array without any changes being referenced in the original

## Day 15: Local storage and event delegation
Learned some really useful stuff here. Try the demo by adding items and clicking them, then refresh the page
